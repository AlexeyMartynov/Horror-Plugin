# HorrorPlugin
This is a test plugin which was made by bybyzyanka for getting the opportunity to provide commercial services (Gravit Launcher Discord Server)

- The player gets the "BLINDNESS" effect if:
1) It's night now.
2) The player is not in his region.
3) There is no light dust in the inventory.
4) There is no other player with light dust within a radius of 10 blocks.
- Light dust is consumed at the rate of 1pc per 20 seconds to cancel the effect of blindness if the conditions above are met. If there are several players with light dust in the radius, the choice of whose light dust is consumed can be any, including random.
- Applying the "glow" effect in any way cancels the blindness effect, but only for the duration of the "glow" and does not apply to players in the district.
